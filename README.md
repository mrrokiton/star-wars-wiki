# Star Wars Wiki

This project is small Star Wars wikipedia application.
Database for it is SWAPI.

Project is currently loading slowly as it is downloading whole data. The point of this is to have data sorted as API doesn't support sorting.

Some of the data is missing such as planets and vehicles images due to lack of them in [Star Wars Visual Guide](https://starwars-visualguide.com/#/)
